    <p>Eagles are majestic birds, renowned for their strength, courage, and sharp vision.
         Known for having eyesight up to four to eight times sharper than humans, eagles can spot prey from miles away while soaring high in the sky.<br>
          With a wingspan that can reach up to 7 feet, their powerful build allows them to glide gracefully and efficiently, using thermal currents to stay airborne with minimal effort.<br>
           Equipped with sharp talons and a strong, hooked beak, eagles are formidable hunters, capable of catching and carrying off prey.<br> 
           They are solitary and territorial, often defending their nests in tall trees or cliffs with great vigor. <br>
           The eagle is a symbol of freedom, strength, and leadership, representing power and independence in various cultures, most famously as the national symbol of the United States.<br>
            Eagles also have a long lifespan, living up to 30 years, and form long-term pair bonds for raising their young.<br>
         These birds are not only remarkable hunters, capable of diving at speeds over 100 mph, but also embody the spirit of resilience and determination, inspiring those who seek to overcome life's challenges.</p>
