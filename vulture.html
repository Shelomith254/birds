    <p>Vultures are fascinating birds often misunderstood due to their appearance and feeding habits. <br>
        As nature’s clean-up crew, they play a vital role in the ecosystem by feeding on dead animals, preventing the spread of disease.<br>
         With incredibly strong stomach acid, they can safely digest rotting meat that would harm other animals.<br>
          Their bald heads help them stay clean while feeding, and their excellent eyesight allows them to spot carcasses from miles away.<br>
           Vultures are skilled gliders, able to soar for hours using thermal currents with minimal wing flapping.<br>
            Though they don’t sing like many birds, their silent nature is part of their uniqueness, using hisses and grunts to communicate.<br>
             In many cultures, vultures symbolize rebirth and cleansing, turning death into life by keeping the environment balanced and healthy.</p>
